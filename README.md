# PHP-OOPS CRUD Skeleton
 Quick To Use Ajax based CRUD skeleton
 
 Note: The contact entries are auto generated values. Didn't used any routers or .HTACCESS mods to implement MVC. 

Designed as a Single Page CRUD Module using Jquery and Ajax. On Backed used Model(db) View(index) Controller(action) approach.
